"""Default least-privilege scope for a HIPAA phone scheduler.

Deny-by-default: the only verb allowed is `run_call`, and only to allowlisted
scheduling recipients / regions, with bounded params and a per-call cost cap.
PHI is never part of the scope — the call *content* is the agent's job; the
protocol bounds *whether* and *to whom* the agent may dial.
